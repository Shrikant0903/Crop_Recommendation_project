> 🤠 **A machine learning-powered crop recommendation system that helps farmers choose the most suitable crops for their soil and weather conditions.** 🌍💡

---

## 🌟 **Project Overview**
This project takes **soil and weather data** as input — such as:
- 🌡️ Temperature
- 💧 Humidity
- 🌧️ Rainfall
- 🧪 Soil Nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium)

And recommends the most appropriate crop for **maximum yield and sustainability**. 🌳🍀
